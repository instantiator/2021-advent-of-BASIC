# 2021-advent-of-BASIC

Join [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), complete a puzzle every day in the language of your choice.

I'll be doing it in BBC BASIC - a coding language from a computer called the [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) first released in 1981. Just like me.

Solution code is provided per day, and you can explore each at [bbcmic.ro](https://bbcmic.ro/) - just copy it in to the editor, and press `run`.
